# AI Native Journey



Welcome to my **AI Native Journey** repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning path and projects related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and AI-native application development.



---



## About This Repository



This space serves as a personal log and showcase for my journey into the world of AI. Here, you'll find:



* Code examples and small projects exploring AI concepts.

* Notes and summaries from courses, tutorials, and readings.

* Experiments with AI tools and frameworks.

* My progress in building AI-powered applications.



The goal is to continuously learn, build, and share as I explore various facets of artificial intelligence, from foundational principles to advanced applications.



## Getting Started



This repository is primarily for learning and exploration. If you're following along or just curious:



1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash

    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/AI_Native_JOURNEY.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/AI_Native_JOURNEY.git)

    cd AI_Native_JOURNEY

    ```

    *Remember to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.*



2.  **Explore the Branches/Folders:**

    As I progress, I'll organize content into different branches or folders, typically by topic or project. Check out the `main` branch for the latest updates and an overview.



## Current Focus / Next Steps



* [ ] Setting up initial development environment (Python, necessary libraries).

* [ ] Exploring basic Machine Learning concepts (e.g., linear regression, classification).

* [ ] Understanding large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering.

* [ ] Building a simple AI-powered script.



_This section will be updated regularly as I move through my learning journey!_



## Contributing (or Learning Together!)
